# Memorize - iOS Memory Game App
Memorize is an iOS memory game app developed using Swift and SwiftUI by following along the lectures from the Stanford CS193p course. 
While adhering to the course's foundational concepts, I made changes and implemented additional features, such as dynamic difficulty levels and a time-based bonus system, 
to enhance the gameplay experience.

### How I Extended the App
After finishing the Stanford CS193p course, I implemented custom features that expand beyond the course content:
* Developed dynamic difficulty levels, allowing the player to choose the level of challenge.
* Added a time-based bonus system, rewarding the player for completing the game faster.
* Enhanced the user interface with smooth animations and custom themes for a more engaging user experience.
